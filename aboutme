raw shitty website because im lazy, anyways my name is grace and used to fw scripting heavily. scripting has been fun for a while but i have realized i hate doing anything scripting related shit for others, or well stuff i do not find any fun in. anyways to much yapping about scripting back to me!! i play a bit of rainbow six siege, valorant (started kind of new.), minecraft from time to time if i really dont find fun in anything else and thats kind of it. i listen to lots of uptempo which is a genre basically nobody else listens to. how 90% of the people i met would describe it is "straight noises" do whatever with that fact. im honestly normally pretty quiet and dont like talking but as soon as there is a single person that i know ill be the loudest in the room, dont even know if thats a pro or con. i actually forgot to mention that i love travelling. at this point ive been almost everywhere but africa (well i was in egypt but thats beside the point) .heres a little list to where ive been to of the top of my head.. america, mexico, brazil, spain, france, italy, austria, going to czech pretty much every year, netherlands, belgium, germany (where im from idk why i even listed this i think cus i didnt mention it anywhere else), poland, and ukraine before the war. the war breaking out was actually heart breaking. as weird as it sounds most of my child memories are and come from ukraine. i was also in china, thailand, laos (only for a day), vietnam and i think thats it.. well then that was much yapping if ur actually intrested in me i would appreciate a dm - "debrainers" on discord you can also check out my socials https://debrainers.xyz/
